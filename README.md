An interactive React application that showcases student-created book presentations while offering an engaging guessing game to test users' knowledge of books.

## üìö Project Overview

"Whose Book Is This?" is a multi-faceted project that combines:

1. A collection of student-created book presentations in HTML
2. React components with traditional CSS styling
3. React components with modern styled-components
4. A complete interactive React application with a book guessing game

The project demonstrates the evolution from basic HTML presentations to fully interactive React components, showcasing different styling approaches and modern web development techniques.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

This repository is organized into four main directories:

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `/app` | Complete React application with the book guessing game |
| `/books` | React components with traditional CSS |
| `/booksc` | React components with styled-components |
| `/bookhtml` | Original HTML versions of student book presentations |

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Book Collection**: Browse through student-created book presentations
- **Interactive Game**: Guess books based on hints and earn points
- **Multiple Styling Approaches**: Compare traditional CSS vs styled-components
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices
- **React Router Navigation**: Smooth navigation between pages

## üéÆ The Game

The "Whose Book Is This?" game challenges players to identify books based on hints:

1. A random book is selected from the collection
2. Players are given hints about the book one at a time
3. The fewer hints needed to guess correctly, the higher the score
4. Points awarded: 1 hint (15 points), 2 hints (10 points), 3 hints (5 points)

## üöÄ Getting Started
